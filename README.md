# CosmicRipple

## About

This was a test concept to learn several things:
1. how to manage canvas
2. how to handle JS with Classes
3. how to manage a lightweight 2D Renderer (that handles FPS)

Along with that this project (specifically this GitHub project) was also an excuse to start to understand JS modules.

## Testing it out

You can check out a working version here: [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Event_Horizon/pen/jOGxXgB)

If you want to download and test **locally**, you must run it as a **server** due to how modules work.

## References

I was reading about canvas and decided to dive headfirst into it by trying to draw a hex grid.

When I wasn't sure why I was running into issues with rows/columns I found and referenced: [https://eperezcosano.github.io/hex-grid/](https://eperezcosano.github.io/hex-grid/)

I was working in Unity when I realized I could recreate a subset of their Vector2D type as a class to possibly simplify some of the code.
