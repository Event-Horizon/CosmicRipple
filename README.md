## About

This was a test concept to learn several things:
1. how to manage canvas
2. how to handle JS with Classes
3. how to manage a lightweight 2D Renderer (that handles FPS)
4. how to do basic AI state management

Along with that this project (specifically this GitHub project) was also an excuse to start to understand JS modules.

## Testing it out

You can check out a working version here of the Hexagon animation: [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Event_Horizon/pen/jOGxXgB)

You can check out a working version here of the AI/State management: [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Event_Horizon/pen/ZEazZjd)

If you want to download and test **locally**, you must run it as a **server** due to how modules work.

## References

I was reading about canvas and decided to dive headfirst into it by trying to draw a hex grid.

When I wasn't sure why I was running into issues with rows/columns I found and referenced: [https://eperezcosano.github.io/hex-grid/](https://eperezcosano.github.io/hex-grid/)

I was working in Unity when I realized I could recreate a subset of their Vector2D type as a class to possibly simplify some of the code.

I watched a couple state machine videos on YouTube when I decided I wanted to take some of the Hexagon canvas project code to create an AI project in canvas.
